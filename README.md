Example

Run npx expo start and start in simulator
Expo CLI will install relevant version of Expo Go in the simulator
Expo Go will attempt to open but crash back to simulator home screen instead

This happens with the Expo Go versions for SDK 46 to 48
If I downgrade app to SDK 45, Expo CLI then installs an Expo Go version that works without crashing
